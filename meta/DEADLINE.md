## Part 1: App Description

> Please provide a firendly description of your app, including the app

> of the app.

I chose the classic arcade Snake. The user is represented by the ArrayList of rectangles, and it tries to eat the randomly generated apple.
If the user runs into the walls or its own tail (by wrapping around and touching it, not from turning around), the game is over. The user
also has the option to restart or exit the app when the game over information is displayed. The snake is moved when a user holds down a key.

How much you need to think about for game design, most specifically the elements where I needed to interact with the user.
I thought that it would be intuitive since Snake is a simple game, yet I was challenged by moving the snake with arrow keys.

## Part 3: Retrospect

I had a good approach with planning out my methods, but I should have started with my sprites first. I was focused too high-level, and worried where to put
    certain methods. I should have focused on setting and reaching an attainable goal every time I sat down to code, like getting the apple to show up/generate randomly. It would
    be much more rearding, and easier to track my progress instead of writing out all the method skeletons first, and then getting my visual elements up.
